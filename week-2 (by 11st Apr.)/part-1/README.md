# Week 2 Part 1

## Assignment

1. No matter if the user-selected cell is in the `Home Page` or in the `Catalog Page`, the app will push the `Detail Page` you built in Week 1 Part 5.
2. Establish [Add To Cart Page](https://zpl.io/aNKLDKD) with `BottomSheetDialogFragment`.
3. The size selections should be synchronized with color selections. Different color has different size set.
4. Display stocks when size is chosen by user, and check if the purchase is out of stock or not. You should disable the relative button.
5. There is an EditText in the last. Please make sure its keyboard inputType is `number`.
6. The default value of EditText's text is `1`.
7. Make sure EditText is not covered by keyboard.
8. The animation that reminds the users they have successfully added product into the cart is a DialogFragment.
9. You don't need to implement any function for `add product into cart` in this part. Just display the hint of the action to user is fine.

## Hint

1. Try to record the color selected position for size selection.
2. Two-way binding of EditText
