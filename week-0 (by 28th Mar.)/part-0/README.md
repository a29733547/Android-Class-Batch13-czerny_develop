# Week 0 Part 0

## Before assignment

Programmers have naming convention about remote repository when using git.

* **upstream** means repository created by the owner.

* **origin** means repository forked by you.

From now on, we're going to start the project `STYLiSH`.

1. **Fork** this repository from `upstream` to your GitHub account.
2. **Clone** the repository from `origin` to your **local machine**.
3. Create a `develop` branch from `main` branch in your **local machine**.
4. Change your current branch from `main` to `develop`.

Every time before you start a new assignment, please create a **new branch** from the **most recent assignment branch** with the following rules and complete the assignment on that branch.

```
Branch naming rules:

  week_(week number)_part_(part number)

Ex: For Week 0 Part 2

  => week_0_part_2
```

## Assignment

1. Create a Android project with the name **STYLiSH** under the `students/${your_name}` folder. (e.g. students/Wayne/STYLiSH)
2. Make your first commit for the changes using git.
3. Push the current assignment branch to your **origin**.

## How to hand-in?

Please find the assignment branch on your `origin` and make a pull request from this branch to `${your_name}_develop` of the `upstream`. (Please never make a pull request to the master of the upstream)

You should check your email to track the status of pull requests. If your pull requests get rejected by repository host, it means that the assignment have issues that should be fixed. I will mention the issues in the comment.

**Please fix the issues and push new commits to the same assignment branch. The pull request will automatically update itself, so you don't have to create another pull request for the same assignment.**

## Review - You should learn

1. If there's an existing GitHub repo, what should we do when co-working with the repo owner.
